👋 Hello and welcome to the** $60,000 in USDC MANTRA Chain** audit channel!

📆 Audit opens Friday, 29 November 2024 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Monday, 06 January 2025 (20:00 UTC) (38 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the MANTRA team, particularly @Delroy, @jvr0x, and @mantra_man , who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a PRIVATE thread. You can expect them to be available in Europe & Asia time zones. 

🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  *Docs Wolf will be available when the audit is live.*

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

I would like to ask, I submitted a potentially sensitive issue for Mantra Chain - disclosed privately, but I couldn't find the private threads in Discord.

Can only one vulnerability with a severity of QA be submitted?


[12/03/2024 13:15] 0xsorrynotsorry
Yes

[12/03/2024 13:45] gxh6709
Does a QA report only allow one vulnerability to be included, rather than multiple?


[12/03/2024 13:55] 0xsorrynotsorry
that´s also possible.
So the warden can send only 1 QA report that includes 1 issue only.
But that doesn´t sound logical due to  only the top 3 QA reports are  subject to have rewards

ℹ️ Wardens, FYI we've added @jvr0x, Mantra's SC engineer, to the list of sponsor team members to tag in private threads if you have questions about the codebase.


[12/10/2024 06:36] p0wd3r_
@Delroy @mantra_man @jvr0x Can users transfer tokens created by the token factory through IBC?


[12/10/2024 08:55] del.roy
Yes you can

Hey, sponsors
Can you see the private thread?


[12/23/2024 21:57] cloudellie (pinned)
@🐺Wardens Since this audit includes live code, a reminder about [Code4rena's "live criticals" policy](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#the-live-criticals-exception), which outlines how C4 handles disclosures of critical/high-severity bugs in deployed code.

- The code in scope for this audit is Mantrachain v1.0.2
- Release history: https://github.com/MANTRA-Chain/mantrachain/releases

Hi everyone, for issues that we have submitted as a team to the helpdesk according to the ["live criticals" policy](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#the-live-criticals-exception), two questions: 

a) shall we keep the placeholder finding, or submit the full issue description now?
b) does it matter who submitted the issues for any scoring purposes/leaderboards now or in the future (e.g. person A submitted, but person B and C from the team found the issue)?

a) preferably full so we can verify
b) doesn't as long as its a team

[01/06/2025 14:44] cloudellie
At the risk of contradicting @bytes032  -- please keep the placeholder finding only to ensure that any critical issues are kept private to the sponsor team and C4 staff only. 

The @💁🏽Engagement Managers team will ensure that the full body of the finding is added once the sponsor team has had a chance to mitigate any critical issues.

for anyone who understands slot0 in uniswap v3
============================
i have question for slot0, about how price can be affected lets say, i have a pair tokenA/tokenB, and tokenB in its ecosystem.. has functionality of flashminting..
that is new tokens can be minted in large quantities.. use the tokens and then at the end of it all burn those tokens, 
so my question is lets say we call flashmint in tokenB.. it mints new tokens in large quantities ..we then call slot0 to check price will slot0 be affected? by showing the effects of the minting new large quantities?

Hi @CloudEllie


[02/13/2025 16:59] rodiontr
Is there any reason why a “potential sensitive issue” can’t be seen during pjqa ?


[02/13/2025 16:59] rodiontr
Or it’s judged separately


[02/13/2025 17:01] cloudellie

Congrats guys.
I couldn't see any vunerabilities when I review codes.
Can't wait to see the report. I'd like to learn.
